# CrewPortraits 
## Description
It's a very modest mod that addresses a nagging little detail. Even worse then some parts having no IVA is some parts not displaying when some poor Kerbal is aboard. I can't tell you how many I've accidently left orbiting in a Mobile Processing Lab or worse, left aboard when I deorbited the station!!!!

No more.

Leveraging the incredible capabilities of ModuleManager (Which is REQUIRED!!) I've created a config that will add Squad's own "Placeholder" IVA to ANY and all parts that can hold a crew but have no IVA model.

Best of all, it checks first and runs last, so if you have some other mod attaching an IVA to part X, my config will see that and leave it alone - now and in the future.
